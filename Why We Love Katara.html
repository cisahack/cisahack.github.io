            <p>Here are 5 refreshers on how Katara touched our hearts...</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Her famous quote that shows how much she cares about people (below).</li>

                        <br>
                    <li>Katara is warm, brave, and passionate. She inspired captive Earthbenders to retaliate against the Fire Nation, who imprisoned them.</li>

                        <br>
                    <li>She does not like to conform to society's rules. After Master Pakku refused to teach her waterbending due to her being a girl, she resisted by attacking him and showed him her waterbending skills.</li>
